This is a mod to add more type of scientist facility slots. Hopefully there will be more on the way.
There are a few UI bugs that I am aware of - these may be fixed in the future.
Be aware that assigning a scientist to any post other than a laboratory slot will stop their contribution to research.
This mod currently has limited functionality on existing saved games - any facilities that have already been built will not have the scientist slots. Rebuilding them will fix this.

Current additions - 

Workshop - Creates drones which can staff scientist slots.
Resistance Comms - Increases your scanning speed by 100%.
Proving Grounds - If a project is completed whilst a scientist is assigned, all future projects of that type will complete instantly.

This mod Overrides the following classes. It will be incompatible with any mod which also overrides these.
